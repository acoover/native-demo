# Native Demo

A minimal Flask webapp demonstrating a signup flow and simple homepage.

The home page shows a fake coin balance for each user and a button to
"Purchase Coins" which opens a modal displaying example coin packages.

## Running

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5000/signup` to create a user profile.
